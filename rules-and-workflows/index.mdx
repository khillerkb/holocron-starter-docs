# Rules and Workflows

Automate repetitive tasks, enforce business logic, and create sophisticated process flows using our rules engine and workflow builder.

## What are Rules?

Rules are conditional statements that automatically execute actions when specific conditions are met. They provide a simple way to implement business logic without writing code.
